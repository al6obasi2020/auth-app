## Requirements

### Front-End Development

The front-end component of this task is built using the **React** framework. Below are the requirements for each part of the user authentication flow:

#### Sign-Up Page

- **Purpose**: Create a sign-up form with validation and submit functionality.

    - Minimum length of 8 characters.
    - At least 1 letter.
    - At least 1 number.
    - At least 1 special character.
- **Redirect**: After a successful sign-up, users are redirected to the application page.

#### Sign-In Page

- **Purpose**: Create a sign-in form for users who already have an account.
- **Fields**:
  - **Email**: User's email address.
  - **Password**: User's password.
- **Validation**: Basic validation to ensure both fields are filled before submission.

#### Application Page

- **Purpose**: Display a welcome message.
- **Message**: "Welcome to the application."

### Back-End Development

The back-end is implemented using the **NestJS** framework with **MongoDB** as the database. Below are the requirements and implementation notes:

#### Requirements

- **Sign-Up and Sign-In Endpoints**:

  - **Database**: MongoDB
  - **ORM**: Chosen ORM based on the project’s needs (e.g., Mongoose).

#### Nice-to-Have Features

- **TypeScript**: The project is developed using TypeScript.
- **Logging**: Basic logging is implemented on the backend to track authentication actions.
